# crypto-monitor

This is a sample app I built for testing out [`React Query`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/).

In this app you will find a list of famous crypto assets and you can add them to a watch list.

`window.localStorage` is used for storing the watch list.

API Used ---> `https://api.coincap.io/v2`
